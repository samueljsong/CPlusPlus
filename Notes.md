# Notes
This will contain notes regarding C++ and some computer science fundamentals.

1. Memory Management
    - Stack vs Heap
    - Manual memory management
    - Memory leaks and dangling pointers
    - Pointer arithmetic
    - Object Lifetimes

2. Value Semantics
    - Pass by value and Pass by reference
    - Copy vs move semantics
    - Rvalue references (&&)

3. Low-Level Data Representation
    - Pointers and addresses
    - Byte level access
    - Bitwise Operations
    - Memory alignment and padding

4. Concurrency and Synchronization
    - Threads
    - Mutexes and locks
    - Condition variables
    - Data races and deadlocks

5. Compilation and Linking
    - Header vs implementation file
    - Compilation units and linking
    - Static vs Dynamic linking 
    - Preprocessor macros

6. Resource Management 
    - RAII
    - Smart Pointers

7. Performance and Optimizations
    - Cache locally
    - inlining and function call overhead
    - Move vs Copy cost
    - Const correctness

8. Undefined behavior and safety
    - Undefined behavior
    - Lifetime and ownership violation 
    - Type punning and strict aliasing

9. System-Level Interactions
    - Manual file I/O
    - Sockets and networking
    - Direct access to OS API's 
    - Embedded/low-level programming
